### A small lesson in the computer network course:  programming to achieve Hamming coding and CRC coding.

And this is my first time to write an English README. But the comments in codes are still in Chinese.

Encode.py and decode.py are Hamming encoded files, all of which can be run separately without a graphical interface.
Tkhamming.py is a graphical interface for Hamming encoding, which contains the functions of the above two files.

The same as CRC files.
